# SQL Project: Billionaires Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project explores the world's richest individuals using SQL. 
By analyzing a dataset of billionaires, I extracted key insights into their net worth, industries, geographical distribution, and demographics. 
The queries demonstrate my growing SQL skills, including filtering, grouping, aggregating, and performing calculations on structured data.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For querying, filtering, and analyzing the dataset.
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Data Source**: Billionaires dataset with information on net worth, country, industry, and more.

## Key Features
- **Exploration**: Identifying countries, industries, and demographics represented in the dataset.
- **Aggregation**: Analyzing average net worth, counts, and percentages.
- **Filtering**: Extracting insights based on specific conditions (e.g., self-made billionaires, top industries).
- **Experimentation**: Trying out custom queries to explore age, wealth, and geographical trends.

## SQL Code
Below is the SQL code used for the analysis:

-- List of billionaires
SELECT * FROM `dataset one`;

-- Name and net worth of people on the list
SELECT personName, finalWorth FROM `dataset one`
LIMIT 10;

-- Different countries on the list
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM `dataset one`;

SELECT country, COUNT(personName) AS people_count
FROM `dataset one` 
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY people_count DESC;

-- Number of countries on the list
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) FROM `dataset one`;

-- Number of people on the list
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT personname) FROM `dataset one`;

-- Average net worth
SELECT AVG(finalWorth) FROM `dataset one`;

-- People from France but not Paris
SELECT * FROM `dataset one`
WHERE country = 'france' AND city <> 'paris';

-- People from France and Spain
SELECT * FROM `dataset one`
WHERE country = 'france' OR country = 'spain';

-- People from India, Japan, China, and Singapore
SELECT * FROM `dataset one`
WHERE country IN('india', 'japan', 'china', 'singapore');

-- Number of self-made billionaires
SELECT COUNT(personname) FROM `dataset one`
WHERE selfmade = 'false';

-- Number of people by industry (top 10)
SELECT industries, COUNT(personname) AS people_count FROM `dataset one`
GROUP BY industries
ORDER BY COUNT(personname) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Number of people by birth month
SELECT birthmonth, COUNT(personname) FROM `dataset one`
GROUP BY birthMonth
ORDER BY COUNT(personname) DESC;

-- Experimentation
SELECT * FROM `dataset one`;
SELECT finalWorth, selfMade FROM `dataset one`;
SELECT personName, age FROM `dataset one` WHERE age < 35;
